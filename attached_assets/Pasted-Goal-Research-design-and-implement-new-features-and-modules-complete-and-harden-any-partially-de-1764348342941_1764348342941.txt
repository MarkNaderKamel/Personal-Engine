Goal: Research, design, and implement new features and modules; complete and harden any partially developed modules; improve the UI so the app looks professional; and move all navigation buttons into a left sidebar (not the header). Deliver working, well-structured, and tested features.

Instructions for the developer / team / AI agent

Research & propose

Investigate and list at least 6 new feature/module ideas relevant to the system (brief description, user value, priority level: high/medium/low).

For each proposed idea, include a rough implementation plan (components, data model changes, API endpoints, and UI mockup notes).

Implementation & completion

Start implementing the approved features and modules immediately. Prioritize incomplete modules first (bug fixes, missing logic, integrations).

Ensure every module has: clear folder structure, tests (unit/integration where applicable), and documentation (README and brief usage notes).

UI / UX changes

Move all navigation buttons and links from the header into a collapsible left sidebar with clearly grouped sections. The header should contain only essential global actions (e.g., profile, notifications).

Polish the UI across the app to a professional standard (consistent spacing, typography, color scheme, accessible components). Provide before/after screenshots or short screen recordings for major pages.

Quality & reliability

Validate that all features behave as expected: input validation, error handling, edge cases.

Add logging for critical actions and graceful fallbacks for failures.

Write and run automated tests and provide a test report (tests passed/failed, coverage summary).

Deployment & verification

Build and deploy to the staging environment after major milestones. Provide a deploy checklist and rollback instructions.

Provide a smoke-test guide for QA to verify core user flows.

Deliverables

Updated project plan with priorities and timelines (high-level).

Patch/PRs for completed work with clear descriptions and linked issues.

A short demo (video or sequence of screenshots) showing new/updated features.

Documentation: changelog, updated README, and a short developer onboarding note for the new modules.

Acceptance criteria

All navigation buttons are available only in the left sidebar and function correctly.

Previously undeveloped modules are implemented, documented, and covered by tests.

UI looks consistent and professional across main screens.

No blocking errors in staging; core flows pass smoke tests.
